modes to open file:
1) r this basically open file to read the file 
2) w used to write content in the file
3) a is append mode and used to insert stuff at end of the file
4) r+
5) w+
6) a+


first we need to creat a pointer variable and we create it by "FILE *ptr"
syntax to open file => ptr = fopen("file name", "mode")
syntax to close the file => 


different function in file handling inbuilt in C:
1) fscanf 
function = The fscanf() function reads data from the current position of the specified stream into the locations that are given by the entries in argument-list, if any.
syntax = fscanf(<file pointer>, "%", &<name>)

2) fprintf 
function = the fprintf() function is used to print data into files
syntax = fscanf(<file pointer>, "%", <input>)

3) fgetc
function = read character from file
syntax = fgetc(<enter the value)

4) fputc
function = write the char in file
syntax = f('c', prt) 

5) fseek
function = As the name suggests, fseek() seeks the cursor to the given record in the file.
syntax = fseek(FILE * stream, long int offset, int whence);
extra = where whence means 
    SEEK_SET	Starts the offset from the beginning of the file.
    SEEK_END	Starts the offset from the end of the file.
    SEEK_CUR	Starts the offset from the current location of the cursor in the file.

6) fgets = this is for the string values    

7) fputs = this is for the string values to put the values in files
